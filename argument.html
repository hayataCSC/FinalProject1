            Among the three countries, Japan exhibits trends that command attention. The first feature to be observed is the relative strength of correlations the inflation rate have with unemployment and inflation rates. Japan’s Unemployment vs. Inflation graph follows the traditional Phillips Curve, while the Money supply vs. Inflation graph attests to the established economic theory that the larger increase in money supply causes higher inflation. Although the holistic observation seems to support the established theories on inflation, the analysis of the change in correlations overtime points to some exceptions.

            One of the marked features in the R btw Unemp and Inf graph is the large dip of correlation observed in the late 70s to early 80s. Since each data point represents the correlation in the previous ten-year-period, this dip can be attributed to the economic situation in the 70s. The prominent event in the decade is the Oil Crisis that caused stagflation in economies around the world. Japan was no exception. The pink dots represent data points in the 70s. They all show relatively high inflation rates, with one outlier representing the inflation rate of 23.22 recorded in 1974. However, Japan’s data is notable in that the unemployment rate stayed relatively low compared to the U.S. or E.U. This can be attributed to Japan’s strict labor laws that make it hard for employers to fire workers. After the 70s, the correlation stayed in the strong negative, indicating a negative correlation explained by the traditional Phillips Curve. However, there is a slight trend that indicates that the correlation is weakening over time.

            The correlation between money supply and inflation exhibits a more pronounced trend, with the correlation decreasing overall. There is, however, a noticeable dip around 2008. This can be attributed to the aggressive monetary policy the Bank of Japan took after the financial crisis. Regardless of the dovish policies, the inflation rate stayed low, producing negative correlation coefficients.

            Along with the slightly weakening correlation between unemployment and inflation, the low correlation the inflation rate shows for money supply warrants reexamination into the traditional economic theories on inflation rates. Further research into economic variables that might be influencing the inflation rate is necessary to better understand the recent phenomenon of low inflation.
