                My topic area is Economics. I am going to conduct an exploratory data analysis for my hypothesis about inflation.

                In the past decade, economies worldwide suffered from stubbornly low inflation rates despite tight labor markets. This combination of low inflation and low unemployment seems to violate one of the fundamental principles of economics: there is an inverse correlation between inflation and unemployment. To represent this phenomenon with visualization, the dashboard exhibits graphs showing correlations that the inflation rate has with the unemployment rate and money supply. The economies under consideration are America, Japan, and the European Union.

            <p class="text">
                Using the D3 library, Iâ€™ll create a website to exhibit data in a way by which I can show the correlation between the two variables and inflation rates. Users of my website can switch countries to display.
